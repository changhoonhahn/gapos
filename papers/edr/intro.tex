\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro} 
brief review of scaling relations and the importance of population statistics  

list of all the population statistics paper from SDSS and GAMA. 

introduce DESI and BGS and talk about an opportunity to improve all these
population population statistics

importance of pop statistics for galaxy formation models.

informing semianalytic models and hydrodyanmical simulations

ML acceleration of these models will enable to fitting to observations so it's
imperative that we have the most precise galaxy population statistics.

{\color{red} why this work?} 
In this work, we present the pSMF for galaxies in the Bright Galaxy Survey
observed as part of the DESI One-Percent Survey, a survey validation program
conducted before the main survey operations. 

Furthermore, in this work we present the statistical methodology as well as the
methodology for accounting for observational incompleteness.
