\section{Uncertainties on the SMF} \label{sec:uncert}
We estimate the uncertainties of the SMF from sample variance using the
standard jackknife technique. 
This involves splitting our BGS sample into subsamples and then estimating
uncertainties using the subsample-to-subsample variations:  
\begin{equation} \label{eq:jack} 
    \sigma_\Phi = \left(\frac{N_{\rm jack}-1}{N_{\rm jack}}
    \sum\limits_{k=1}^{N_{\rm jack}} (\Phi_k - \Phi)^2 \right).
\end{equation} 
$N_{\rm jack}$ is the number of jackknife subsamples and $\Phi_k$ represents
the SMF estimated from the BGS galaxies excluding the jackknife subample $k$. 
In this work, we split the BGS sample into 12 jackknife fields based on the
angular positions of galaxies. 
We present the jackknife fields in Figure~\ref{fig:jack} with distinct colors.
